# AliasKeepr
Store aliases in profiles so that they can be moved, and activated on demand.

## Use case
Teams that pair, and share keyboards getting frustrated when they can't `gs` (`git status`) on other team members' machines. In this case, there can be a team git repo of the `.akrc` directory, and importing their aliases is as simple as `ak yourname`.
